So I have recently gotten into a game called Shadow of Mordor. To give a brief description of the game it is Assassin's Creed meets Lord of the Rings. You sneak around the map killing orcs and completing missions. It is an absolute blast of the game to play. Generally, this game is fantastic all around in the UX sense it does a fantastic job. However, as I have played the game there have been two interactions that I feel were not well implemented and they have bothered me about the game as I have played it.

So imagine I have opened the map, my goal at this point was to see the quests or objectives that I have left to do on the current map. So obviously I would press the quest button expecting a drop-down menu or something to show the quests that are left.

However, that is not what happened. Instead, I was shown the picture above. So to give context as to what this is. This is the quest tab, it shows every type of quest or object on every map. Which is great, however not what I expected or wanted. I wanted to see the map I was currently on and see the quests I had to do for that map. You can not see the objects left on the map at the same time as the map. Which causes the entire interaction to be far more confusing. This interaction was not effective. A simple action like trying to see the quests for the current map is overly complicated. I have to go to an entirely different screen and switch between a bunch of different tabs to see what is on that map. That can not be described as effective or satisfying. This can be solved by just adding a retractable menu on the map that shows you the objects left on your current map. It is an easy fix.

So my goal for this interaction was to save the game. The game has a very active autosave but I always save the games I play manually. Usually, I do it at the end of my session just because it makes sure that the game is saved. Usually, I would expect to open up the pause menu and have the save button right there. That was not the case.

My next thought was that it had to be directly under options. However, yet again that was not the case. So I went looking through the options to find the save button that has to be there. As I have figured out, however, a manual save is not an option. This completely flew in the face of my **Mental Mapping**. How I thought the interaction was going to go was I would open the options menu and save would be right at the top. That was not the case instead what happened is the option didn't even exist. This is a common option that has been in video games for many years. Even when autosave had become a main staple in every game we still had that ability to make our saves. It allowed the user to have extra security and confidence that their actions had been saved. The removal of this option honestly made the game feel less safe when it comes to handling my data. Every time I turn off the game I have to just trust that it has been saved. The easy fix for this is just to add the option.
